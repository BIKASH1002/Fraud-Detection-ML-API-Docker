# Containerized Fraud Detection API: Leveraging ML and FastAPI

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning solution for detecting fraudulent transactions. The project includes a trained Machine Learning model, API integration using FastAPI and Containerization using Docker for deployment. The API allows users to input transaction details and get a fraud prediction based on the trained model.

# Overview

This project uses Python, FastAP and Docker to provide a solution for predicting whether a financial transaction is fraudulent based on features like transaction type, amount and balances. The FastAPI application provides an easy-to-use interface where users can interact with the model and get predictions.

The project consists of the following main components:

- A **Machine Learning model** trained using scikit-learn to classify fraudulent transactions.

- An **API** developed using FastAPI for making predictions.

- **Containerization** of the application using Docker for easy deployment and environment consistency.
